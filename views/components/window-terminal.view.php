<?php /*
  Any time you require this partial, it needs to be followed by a closing div tag.

  Example:
  <div class="window-terminal">
    <?php require('components/window-terminal.view.php') ?>
    <h2>Content Title</h2>
    <p>words</p>
  </div>

  This is very basic as limited by using php require rather than laravel or others
  This will just make the correct html structure needed for the terminal's styling to work
